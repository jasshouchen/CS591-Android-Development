Instructions: 
You can build the app and install the app on your phone directly. There should not be any problems. our minimum api is 21. target api is 25. 

After you sign up a new account, please verify your email address before log in. otherwise you will not be able to add new trips. 

When you tab the add new trip button the first time, it will take a relatively long time to open the dialog and it will ask for location service permission. Please don’t double tap it. If the map doesn’t show your current location the first time you open the new trip dialog(it happens sometime), just hit back and reopen it. 

To change your profile photo you need an external storage on your phone. if you have an sd card in your phone, it will work.

We don’t think there are any more special instruction on how to use the app after the demo today. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to email us. Thank you.
